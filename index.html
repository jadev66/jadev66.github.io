                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio launch page. These websites are works in progress as I continue to learn, build, and improve each one but I wanted an opportunity to showcase my abilities. I am working to grow as a developer and to continue to increase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript proficiency.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to obtain a career as a fully remote Front-End Web Developer and to become a valuable member of an organization that encourages knowledge and skill building. Please click on the images below to check out my websites and thank you for visiting.</p>
